Applying the planitude and alatude to proplyds
* Related projects
+ I have another similar project [[file:~/Dropbox/proplyds-vs-bowshocks/proplyds-vs-bowshocks.org][proplyds-vs-bowshocks.org]] but the focus is different.
  + That was inspired by the so-called proplyds in the galactic center
  + They have no stars as far as I can see, and they look more like bow shocks
* TODO Plan of action  
1. [ ] [2019-05-10 Fri] Find suitable observational material
   - For the Orion proplyds this will be basically the same as for the LL arcs
   - But I also want to look at other proplyds and EGGS, etc
     - Carina, and elsewhere
2. [ ] Measure shapes with [[file:~/Dropbox/circle-fit/circle_fit.py]]
3. [ ] Compare with tail length
4. [ ] Compare with dark disk axis ratio and orientation (where available)
